Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation which has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

* In the first notebook the company provided us with three different datasets it's customers transactions,customers demographics and customers addresses so we conducted a Data wrangling on the three datasets and fixed it's quality issues and eventually joined the three datasets together into one big dataset to start analyzing it and answer client's questions

* In the second notebook we made an Exploratory data analysis on the joined datasets and identfied specific trends , and finally i segmented the customers into Four different segments (Platinum,Gold,Silver,Bronze) throught a RFM analysis

* In the third notebook the client provided us with a new customers dataset and asked to recommend which customer to target with our marketing campagins so we used a classification machine learning model and trained our old labelled data on it and fitted it on the new customers data to predict which one will be which segment.
